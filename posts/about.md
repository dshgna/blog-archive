Hello! Welcome to my blog!

I am originally from Sri Lanka. I completed my undergraduate studies in 2015 at the University of Moratuwa. Then I worked for a year as a software engineer at Virtusa before landing it in an opportunity of a lifetime.

I am a Language Analyst in the Community Operations team at Facebook. I work heavily with data and analytics, studying the trends and user interactions of approximately 6 billion in the region of Sri Lanka. I also work in high-impact projects pertaining to the empowerment of women and child safety in South Asia: two causes that strongly motivate me.

I am a hobbyist open-source programmer. I was an Outreachy intern for Mozilla's webcompat project where I work extensively on developing webcompat.com. I also was a mentor for the second round of Learn It Girl where I guided my mentee Neha Rani in creating the "Learn X in 7 Days" project.

In my free time, I love gardening. Back home, we grew almost all our vegetables, if the climate permitted it! 

I have Duane's Syndrome, a rare form of strabismus which impairs vertical eye movement, coordination and speech. The discrimination and difficulties I faced in my life encouraged me to create "Humans of Differentia" a Facebook page sharing stories of differently abled people from around the world.
