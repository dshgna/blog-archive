I am a Language Analyst at Facebook. I work heavily with data and analytics, studying the trends and user interactions of approximately 6 billion in the region of Sri Lanka. I also work in high-impact projects pertaining to the empowerment of women and child safety in South Asia: two causes that strongly motivate me.

I am a hobbyist open-source programmer, contributing to the Mozilla project in my free time. I am an Outreachy intern for Mozilla's webcompat project where I worked extensively on developing webcompat.com. I also was a mentor for the second round of Learn It Girl where I guided my mentee Neha Rani in creating the "Learn X in 7 Days" project.

In my free time, I love exploring. 

I am originally from Sri Lanka where I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Moratuwa in 2015. I worked as a software engineer for a year at Virtusa.

I have Duane's Syndrome, a rare form of strabismus which impairs vertical eye movement, coordination and speech. The discrimination and difficulties I faced in my life encouraged me to create "Humans of Differentia" a Facebook page sharing stories of differently abled people from around the world.
